## Letter of Intent: Inhibition of Alcohol Dehydrogenase as a Treatment for Alcohol Poisoning by Methanol

### Background
Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH; I.U.B. 1.1.1.1)[^1] is an enzyme that consists of two subunits of equal weight, 40 kDa each. ADH can be found in mammalians, many bacteria, and yeast. ADH oxidizes primary and secondary alcohols to form aldehydes and ketones (Figure 1).[^2]

> **Figure 1. General Reaction of Alcohol Dehydrogenase.**  
> ADH metabolizes (oxidizes) alcohol to produce aldehydes or ketones. This process requires the reduction of NAD\^+\ to NADH. NAD serves as a cofactor.[^3]

There are seven different ADH genes, all of which have the most abundant expression in the liver: **ADH1A, ADH1B, ADH1C, ADH4, ADH5, ADH6,** and **ADH7**. They can also be found in the esophagus, small intestine, kidney, adipose, and lungs. Each subunit binds to two Zn²⁺ ions; however, only one is catalytically active (Figure 2). The small and cylindrical shape of the enzyme’s active sites allows narrow substrate specificity.[^2]

The enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, **1ADC**, was isolated from the horse liver of the species *Equus caballus*. The protein was expressed in the bacteria *E. coli* for the crystallography in 1994 by Li H. et al.[^4]

> - (A) The three-dimensional structure of 1ADC was created using Protein Data Bank ID (1ADC), Proteopedia, and its FirstGlance in Jmol component. Subunit 1 is blue, and subunit 2 is green. The ligands associated with each subunit are not shown.  
> - (B) Using Protein Data Bank ID (1ADC), Proteopedia, and its FirstGlance in Jmol component, a single subunit of 1ADC was created with the ligands associated with subunit 1 (Zn²⁺ = zinc ion, PAD = 5-β-D-ribofuranosylpicolinamide adenine dinucleotide, EOH = ethanol).  

The overall structure of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (LADH) and human alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) enzymes are similar, as well as their mechanism.[^4] ADH contains two Zn²⁺ ions; however, only one of the ions (**Zn²⁺ II**) is crucial for the mechanism of action as it is located at the catalytic site. The active site consists of a zinc ion (Zn²⁺ II) that has a water molecule, one histidine (**His67**), and two cysteine residues (**Cys46** and **Cys174**) attached to it (Figure 3). The nitrogen and sulphur donors of the histidine and cysteine residues, respectively, allow the zinc ion to attach to the protein backbone.[^5]

First, ADH binds to the cofactor NAD\^+. This results in a conformational change of the enzyme, and in turn, the water ligand gets displaced by the alcohol substrate. The zinc ion holds the hydroxyl group of the alcohol in place. The zinc-bound alcohol substrate is then deprotonated, forming a zinc alkoxide intermediate. The zinc ion, a positively charged cation, stabilizes the intermediate formed and facilitates the hydride transfer from the substrate to the cofactor. This process yields an aldehyde (that is zinc-bound) and NADH. The aldehyde gets displaced by a water molecule, and the NADH is released as the enzyme returns to its original form, ready to oxidize the next alcohol substrate (Figure 3).[^2][^4][^5][^6]

### Rationale
Secondary alcohols are generally poor substrates for alcohol dehydrogenase. An example of a primary alcohol is methanol, which is oxidized by alcohol dehydrogenase to be converted to formaldehyde and subsequently to formic acid.[^7] While methanol itself is not toxic, its metabolite (formaldehyde) can cause tissue damage and severe illnesses like metabolic acidosis, blindness, cardiovascular instability, or death.[^7] The eyes carry a sensitivity to formaldehyde, leading to blindness.[^8]

In multiple research studies, treatment of methanol poisoning was carried out by testing the ability of the compound **4-methyl-1H-pyrazole (Fomepizole)** (Figure 4) as an inhibitor. The potential of the primary alcohol ethanol as an inhibitor was also tested; however, Fomepizole has a higher affinity for ADH than ethanol. Both Fomepizole and ethanol were found to act as competitive inhibitors of LADH.[^7][^8][^9]

### Research Goal
The goal of the research proposed in this Letter of Intent is to carry out the treatment of methanol toxicity by using **4-methyl-1H-pyrazole (Fomepizole)** as an inhibitor of LADH. Observing the effects of Fomepizole on the activity of LADH can help develop a medical treatment for methanol toxicity. This could be achieved by:

1. Determining the optimal conditions for the activity of LADH (via enzyme assay).
2. Determining the type of inhibition that Fomepizole exerts.
3. Calculating the Ki value of Fomepizole with LADH.

## Research Objectives

1. **Design of LADH Activity Assay**  
   LADH converts methanol to colorless formaldehyde; the cofactor NAD\^+ is reduced to NADH, which has a yellow colour (Figure 5). The production of NADH can be used to determine enzyme activity by measuring absorption at 340 nm (ε = 6.22 mM⁻¹cm⁻¹). The reaction will proceed for 5 minutes upon addition of the enzyme, and absorbance values will be measured using a spectrophotometer in a continuous method. For this proposed research, **human liver alcohol dehydrogenase (LADH)** will be used.[^11]

2. **Evaluation of Optimal pH**  
   To determine the effect of pH on LADH kinetics and establish its optimal pH, several experiments will be set up with a constant enzyme and substrate amount at a constant temperature. pH levels will range between 4 and 10 using different buffer solutions:
   - pH 4–5: phosphate buffer  
   - pH 6–7: Tris-hydroxymethyl aminomethane (Tris)  
   - pH 8–10: HCl (Tris\^+)  
   
   A pH curve will be generated based on the rate of reaction to identify the highest activity (optimal pH).[^12]

3. **Evaluation of Optimal Temperature**  
   To determine the effect of temperature on LADH kinetics and find the optimal temperature, several experiments will be run at different temperatures (15℃ to 50℃, in 5℃ increments). The reaction will contain a constant amount of enzyme and substrate at the determined optimal pH. The temperature that yields the highest rate of reaction will be reported as the optimum temperature (expected to be near 37℃ for a human liver enzyme).

4. **Evaluation of the Fomepizole Inhibitor**  
   - **Without Inhibitor:** Varying substrate concentrations will be used at optimal pH and temperature, with a constant amount of enzyme, buffer, etc. Data collected will be plotted (Lineweaver-Burk) to determine Michaelis Constant (Km) and Maximum Velocity (Vmax).
   - **With Inhibitor:** The same experiment is repeated with an unchanging amount of Fomepizole at various substrate concentrations (again at optimal pH and temperature). Data from both sets (± inhibitor) will be combined in a single Lineweaver-Burk plot to identify the type of inhibition (competitive, uncompetitive, or mixed). This experiment will be repeated with different fixed concentrations of Fomepizole to determine the inhibitor constant (Ki).

## Significance of the Proposed Research
Understanding the relationship between the inhibitor **4-methyl-1H-pyrazole (Fomepizole)** and the enzyme **LADH** is crucial for developing an effective medical treatment for methanol poisoning. By characterizing the mechanism and strength (Ki) of Fomepizole’s inhibition, we can better guide clinical treatments to prevent the dangerous metabolism of methanol into toxic formaldehyde and formic acid.
